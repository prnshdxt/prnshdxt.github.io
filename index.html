            <div id="divCourseAbout" class="tab-module"><div class="tab_heading">About Programming Using Python</div>  <div>  <p>Python is a programming language and is a one of the preferred option today for any high performance computing. The syntax of the language is designed to be readable. In fact, one recent study has shown Python to be the most commonly taught programming language in U.S. schools and was ranked second in the Top 10 Popular Programming Languages in 2015.There is a Python framework for pretty much anything, from web apps to data analysis. Python is often heralded as the easiest programming language to learn, with its simple and straightforward syntax. This course will help you mater the skills of programming using Python . The course also comes with a verified certificate from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) by edX/NIIT .         </p>  </div></div>
